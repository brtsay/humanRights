    "# Classifying Human Rights Tweets with Vowpal Wabbit\n",
    "\n",
    "I tried to help out on a project where the researchers were looking to map the source of tweets abouts human rights in the United States. The training data they used and which was provided to me came from posts made by human rights activists/organizations on Twitter. Both the training/test sets and unlabeled tweets were provided to me with no alteration/supplementation on my part. The following is an attempt to get at the problem using [Vowpal Wabbit](https://github.com/JohnLangford/vowpal_wabbit/wiki) (VW) version 8.1.1. I had a few issues trying to install the [Python package](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/vowpalwabbit) via `pip`, so I decided to install the command-line version from the default Ubuntu repos and use this opportunity to become more familiar with Bash scripting.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a previous attempt, I used Facebook's [fastText](https://fasttext.cc/) to classify the tweets. Since the default training/test data format that fastText accepts is similar to VW's, I will slightly modify it to VW's preferred format. The added benefit is that I have already preprocessed the fastText data to lower-case all words and to remove all URL links and punctuation.\n",

    "We first read in the \"best\" weight from our random search. VW allows uses to assign importance weights to individual training examples. This is generally useful for when the trainng set is unbalanced between different classes, which our training set is. I simply applied a uniform weight (greater than 1) weight to all examples of human rights tweets, since it was the smaller class. The weight of 2 was found via random search, meaning that tweets labeled as being human rights-related are considered 2 times as important (since we keep our non-human rights tweets at weight 1).\n",

    "We then use awk to replace the fastText labels with labels that VW would understand e.g. \"\\_\\_label\\_\\_nonhr\" becomes \"-1 |w \". The VW label format for binary classification has positive labels be \"+1\" and negative labels be \"-1\" with a pipe | separating the label from the actual features. We add a \"w\" after the pipe to tell VW that the actual text will be considered to be in the \"w\" namespace. In VW, features can be split into multiple namespaces, and different actions can be applied to different namespaces. We will add another namespace in the next step.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the other namespace, which we call \"l\", we add the length of the tweet (after it has been preprocessed to remove links and punctuation) as another feature for our classifier. The guess would be that perhaps human rights tweets are less likely to be very short. To get the length, we first use sed to delete the label and then use awk to count the length of the post, saving the output into a separate file. We then paste our \"w\" and \"l\" namespaces together, deleting the temporary files we took them from.\n",

While it's currently set at 10, VW by default engages in early stopping, so it may not actually go through all 10 passes. Since this is a binary classification problem, I conducted random search with either logistic or hinge loss, with the \"best results\" coming from using logistic loss. Random search also determined that it was optimal to use unigrams over bi-, tri-, etc. grams. It's possible that for the \"average\" human rights tweet, surrounding word contexts don't actually matter; what determines human rights content is the presence of just a few keywords. When using n-grams, we can also have the n-grams skip over a number of words rather than just including concurrent words. However, since I am using unigrams, this option does nothing. It was not in the \"best parameters\", but random search also included specifications that included interactions between the \"w\" (the words) and \"l\" (length of tweet) namespaces as a feature.\n",

    "- __More text preprocessing__. Some steps I normally employ that I left out while playing around with VW is removing stopwords (e.g. the, a, ...) and stemming. It's possible that these steps may have helped improve things.\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Manually clean some of the tweets__. To recap, the positive-labeled tweets (tweets considered to be about human rights) were collected from accounts that tweet often about human rights and from posts that used certain hashtags. This strategy is nice because it's presumably low effort and generates a lot of \"labeled\" data rapidly. The downside of this vacuum strategy seems to be that it gets a lot of tweets that would generally be considered unrelated to human rights (see those \"thank you\" tweets). The labeled data could therefore benefit from some manual cleanup and labeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Supplement the training data__. There are 150,000 labeled tweets, with nearly 100,000 of them going to the training set. Given the huge volume of tweets that are produced, this is a very small amount. It's quite likely that the classifier is not being exposed to enough examples of \"regular\" tweets, which can contribute to a feature weighting outcome where many unrelated tweets are labeled as human rights tweets (low precision).\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Force greater regularization__. Models that optimized accuracy or the balanced $F_1$ score tended not to have regularization. However, given what we know about the trustworthiness of the data, optimizing these numbers may not exactly be the way forward; and that we definitely do not want overfitting on this training data. We could therefore run random search (or some other type of search) where all models must have regularization (my current implementation only uses regularization in about half of the random search iterations).\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Take advantage of other VW options__. Some of the options that VW has that I didn't use include boosting and using a multi-layer perceptron with a single hidden layer (with sigmoidal activations I believe). I could try incorporating these, though some initial tests I ran seemed to indicate that they didn't too much to improve things.\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Try different architectures__. A lot of recent advancements in NLP have come through the usage of neural networks. Shallow ones can be used to generate word/sentence/document embeddings. Convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks (e.g. LSTMs) can also be used to incorporate aspects of the sentence sequence/structure into learning and predictions. \n",
    "\n",
    "- __Information retrieval__. Rather than treating this as a machine learning problem, we could treat it as a information retrieval problem. This would require us to come up with a set of search terms. I was also asked to do this by training a classifier. Nevertheless, I tried running this data through [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch) with some terms I came up with, and it seemed to do okay\n",

    "## General Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data quality is important....an obvious one. The way the human rights tweets were collected meant that there are potentially a lot of incorrectly applied labels, which is not fantastic for training...\n",
    "\n",
    "- Can't blindly just optimize numbers. I believe the original goal of this project was to use a trained classifier to label tweets as being about human rights or not, and then to map where the human rights tweets were coming from, geographically. If we had been less discerning, we could have observed the high accuracy, $F_1$ score, precision, etc. on our test set, assumed our classifier is doing great, and then directly map the predictions it generated onto the map. As can be seen from our first attempt, and to somewhat lesser extent our second attempt, this would not have been good, since we'd be mapping a lot of incorrect tweets.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Should interrogate the model. We picked up some insights by taking a look through the tweets that were mislabeled and by looking at the features with the highest weights so that the classifier itself would not be a black box. Using a tool like [lime](https://github.com/marcotcr/lime) could have been useful too.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Vowpal Wabbit is fast. I had heard of Facebook's fastText (some code using it is elsewhere in this repo), and I came across VW while reading discussions about fastText. Both tools are nice and speedy, but one advantage VW had over \\[a Python implementation of\\] fastText was its handling of ngrams. Using more than bigrams brought my laptop (4GB RAM) to a crawl, but VW seemed to handle up to 5-grams quite well.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The command line seems kind of unwieldly for these kinds of tasks. The caveat is that I'm more experienced in tools like Python and R relative to command-line things like Bash, awk, sed, etc. I'm glad that I went through this exercise and got a better handle on command line commands though, since I generally didn't use command line stuff besides moving and renaming files and things."
